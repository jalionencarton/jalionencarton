Hi,

I've been an old cs:go player, i played few games on cs2
and here's my feedback on what I'd like to see change:

- ATH Option: Replace Avatar by NUMBER ("Simple mode" in CSGO)
  And then remove ?V? if if previous step is applied

- Remove Stats in Home Lobby, may make a menu to see them

- Get Rank back & see ranks before ELO like league of legends, ELO could be smaller below or under rank

- Don't split ranks - even at High ELO, players are supposed to have an advanced vision, maccros and mechanics, then split ranks each maps isn't usefull to me) 

- Get back classic iron sight (P90, galil, ak, usp)

- Get back old commands like: bindtoggle, r_cleardecals, cl_righthand

- BUY WHEEL!

- Seeing damages done at death OR in console
  seems to be useless at the end round

- Reduce RED Death Blood Saturation (Cuz' it hurts eyes)

- Remove current kill counter (We are playing CSGO, not valorant!)

- Could be fine to make molotov' more red and add a bit smoke

- Also, i hope than as CSGO, gain elo points isn't resume to WIN or LOSE.
